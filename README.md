# iOS-Runtime-Headers
Headers were generated using [ktool](https://github.com/0cyn/ktool)

You can search the headers with github search, but i plan on making a site to browse these headers.
Uploading them here instead of the future github pages repository due to the alleged 1gb github pages file size limit.

Dumped from iPhone X iOS 15 and iOS 16 ipsws
